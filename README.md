# Amazon-User-Segmentation

#### Introduction of Project

Amazon is renowned for its personalized user experience, which is achieved through sophisticated data analysis and machine learning techniques. One of the key algorithms employed by Amazon to segment users and customize their homepages is the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. This project aims to explore how Amazon utilizes the K-Means algorithm to provide unique homepage experiences for each user by leveraging their historical data.


## Steps:

1. **Decide the Number of Clusters (K)**:
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow Method. This involves plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) and identifying the point where the rate of decrease sharply slows down, forming an "elbow."

2. **Initialize Centroids**:
   - Randomly select K points as the initial centroids. 

3. **Assign Data Points to Closest Centroid**:
   - Calculate the distance between each data point and each centroid. Assign each data point to the closest centroid, forming K clusters.

4. **Update Centroids**:
   - Calculate the new centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points in the cluster.

5. **Repeat Until Convergence**:
   - Reassign each data point to the closest centroid. If any reassignment occurs, go back to step 4. Otherwise, the algorithm has converged, and the final clusters are formed.



### Conclusion

The K-Means Clustering Algorithm is a powerful tool for user segmentation, enabling Amazon to deliver personalized content and recommendations. By understanding user preferences and behaviors through clustering, Amazon can create a more engaging and efficient shopping environment.

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering in segmenting Amazon users, providing a foundation for further exploration and refinement of personalized user experiences on e-commerce platforms.
